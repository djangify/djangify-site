        Quick Answers to Common Mini Ecommerce Questions
      </h2>
      <div class="space-y-6">
        <div>
          <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-[color:var(--color-font-main)]">What is a mini ecommerce shop?</h3>
          <p class="mt-2 text-[color:var(--color-font-main)]">
            A mini ecommerce shop is a small, focused online store built around a handful of products - often one to ten. 
            It is ideal for creators, teachers, or hobbyists who want to sell what they know without the complexity of large platforms. 
            Each product serves a specific purpose, and everything runs from one simple dashboard you control. There are no huge subscriptions (just a monthly hosting fee) and no clutter. Just a clean, purposeful setup.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-[color:var(--color-font-main)]">How many products should I start with?</h3>
          <p class="mt-2 text-[color:var(--color-font-main)]">
            You can choose to start with one clear product, then expand naturally. A single digital guide, printable, or course is enough to launch your store. 
            Once you understand your buyers’ needs, you can add related offers such as bundles or templates, that build on your first product. 
            Fewer choices keep your message clear and make setup and management much easier to sustain long term.
            Most creators already have two or three products they want to sell. I will set up anything from one to six products for you to help you get started.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-[color:var(--color-font-main)]">Can I run a store if I am not a business owner?</h3>
          <p class="mt-2 text-[color:var(--color-font-main)]">
            Yes. Djangify was created for individuals who simply want to share their skills or experience as well as business owners. 
            You do not need to register a business right away — you can sell under your own name while learning the process. However, you should consider tax laws when starting.
            The focus is on starting small, gaining confidence, and building something that fits your life, not building a company overnight.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-[color:var(--color-font-main)]">What happens after payment?</h3>
          <p class="mt-2 text-[color:var(--color-font-main)]">
             The store I build for you is just like this one. Once you pay successfully, a thank you page will appear with a download link. You can download the PDF - complete it and send it to me with your products and images. You will also find the download in your dashboard area when you log in. I usually ask for this information to be returned within 72 hours. Once returned your site will be ready days later. The sooner I receive your information the quicker your site is ready for you.
          </p>
        </div>
        
        <div>
          <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-[color:var(--color-font-main)]">How long does setup take?</h3>
          <p class="mt-2 text-[color:var(--color-font-main)]">
            I set up your fully working store in three to five days once you have your products and images ready. 
            Djangify handles the structure, checkout, and payments - making sure it all works before handover. 
            The setup is straightforward, tested for reliability, and designed for creators who value simplicity. Once complete I hand over all log in details and you are free to add additional products or make any other amendments.

            Every Djangify shop is structured for strong search visibility. 
            Pages load quickly, include schema markup, and are optimised for AI search engines. 
            Your job will be to promote your site and/or individual products on social media, via paid ads or however you choose to market yourself online. 
            Over time, consistent visibility and clear product descriptions will help your store build organic traffic and trust.

            Absolutely. Djangify’s modular design allows you to expand at your own pace. 
            You can upload new products, adjust pricing, and create bundles whenever you’re ready. 
            Many creators begin with one main offer and add companion items such as workbooks, templates, or guides. 
            There’s no technical limit to growth — but the focus remains on keeping your shop simple, profitable, and sustainable.
